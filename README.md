A small code that explains the docker installation, running, and visualization of the PRISMS-PF microgalvanic corrosion application.

## Getting started
For this demo, we're going to use Docker to grab an image of PRISMS-PF v2.4.0 and run one of our pre-built applications, microgalvanic corrosion.

If you want a brief explanation about what Docker is and why we use it, go [here](https://prisms-center.github.io/phaseField/doxygen/3.0.0-pre/docker.html).

**_NOTE:_** The documentation for PRISMS-PF 3.0 is being redone.
